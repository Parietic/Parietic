Hello o/<br>
I'm just a chill dude (At least I like to think so) learning and challenging myself everyday.<br>
Usually I see something I'm interested in and jump in making a demo project, learning along the way!

From projects in the past I've gained some experience in `Python`, `C`, `C#`; recently adding `JavaScript`, `HTML` and `CSS` to the list.

### Current
- Full-stack engineer in training 💪
- Learning the in's and out's of [Scarpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/blob/master/docs/scarpet/Documentation.md) so I can start contributing.

<!-- ### Past -->
###### Portfolio website and LinkedIn profile are works in progress.
